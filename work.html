    <p>Free after a year of abusive captivity, Chelsea Owen has the rest of her life ahead of her. 
      But this girl from the suburbs is not the type to let an injustice go. 
      If the police can’t catch her kidnappers, she’ll bring them to justice herself. 
      Told from the perspectives of Chelsea and her private investigator, Sean Polanco, 
      this story revolves around a victim’s relentless search for closure.</p>
    
    <p>This book is intended to the be the first in a series revolving around Chelsea and Sean.</p>
    
    <p>My inspiration for this story comes from my love of the characters and prose of Gillian Flynn thrillers, 
      the social conscience of crime books like Attica Locke's <i>Bluebird, Bluebird</i>, 
      my favorite antihero series <i>Breaking Bad</i> and <i>Dexter</i>,
      the movies that successfully bridge blockbuster and commentary in the vein of <i>The Dark Knight</i>,
      and of course, my love for L.A. in all its sprawl and culture and history.</p>

    <h3><i>India and the American Revolution</i></h3>
    <p>After learning of the prominent role the Indian subcontinent played in the War of American Independence, 
      I have conducted independent research on this particular aspect of America's founding in the United States, 
      the U.K., and India.</p>

    <p>"The final battles of the American Revolution were fought not in North America but in India, another theater where Britain and France were vying for political dominance. In both the United States and India, as well as throughout the developing world, legacies of that distant war persist."</p>
