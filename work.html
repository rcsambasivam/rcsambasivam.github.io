  <h2>The Chelsea Fix</h2>
  <p>Free after a year of abusive captivity, Chelsea Owen has the rest of her life ahead of her. 
  But this girl from the suburbs is not the type to let an injustice go. 
  If the police can’t catch her kidnappers, she’ll bring them to justice herself. 
  Told from the perspectives of Chelsea and her private investigator, Sean Polanco, 
  this story revolves around a victim’s relentless search for closure. 
  <strong>I am seeking representation for this work.</strong>
