  <h2>The Chelsea Fix</h2>
  <p>Free after a year of abusive captivity, Chelsea Owen has the rest of her life ahead of her. 
  But this girl from the suburbs is not the type to let an injustice go. 
  If the police can’t catch her kidnappers, she’ll bring them to justice herself. 
  Told from the perspectives of Chelsea and her private investigator, Sean Polanco, 
  this story revolves around a victim’s relentless search for closure. 
  <strong>I am seeking representation for this work.</strong>
    
    <p>This book is intended to the be the first in a series revolving around Chelsea and Sean.</p>
    
    <p>My inspiration for this story comes from my love of the characters and prose of Gillian Flynn thrillers, 
      the social conscience of crime books like Attica Locke's <i>Bluebird, Bluebird</i>, 
      my favorite antihero series <i>Breaking Bad</i> and <i>Dexter</i>,
      the movies that bridge blockbuster and social commentary in the vein of <i>The Dark Knight</i>,
      and of course, my love for L.A. in all its sprawl and culture and history.</p>
