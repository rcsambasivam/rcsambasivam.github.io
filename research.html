    <h4>India and the American Revolution</h4>
    <p>After learning of the prominent role the Indian subcontinent played in the War of American Independence, 
      I have conducted independent research on this particular aspect of America's founding in the United States, 
      the United Kingdom, and India.</p>

    <p>"The final battles of the American Revolution were fought not in North America but in India, another theater where Britain and France were vying for political dominance. In both the United States and India, as well as throughout the developing world, legacies of that distant war persist."</p>
